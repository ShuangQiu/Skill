Dir Jelena,
I had to fix my skill mode before answering to you.
indeed, it was not working anymore with emacs > 22, because they removed the possibility in emacs to echo a string to stdout in 'interactive mode' (still feasible in batch mode). They had for some emacsclient reason changed the function `send-string-to-terminal' (how stupid of them).
So i manage to find a workaround with Linux named piped. But then, it should work too with Allegro skill on Window/mobaxterm (but that's another matter).
To explain briefly, before i was doing :
_CADENCE SIDE   ____________________________________
ipcBeginProcess("emacs" "" (lambda (cid data) evalstring(data))) 
_EMACS SIDE ________________________________________
 (write-region (region-beginning) (region-end) "~/.emacs2icfb.il")  (send-string-to-terminal "load(\"~/.emacs3icfb.il\")")
And magically a bindkey was executing the code in cadence. I have a log file with few standard function and when on the line of the function, bindkey C-v will executes it like :
geOpen(?lib "analogLib" ?cell "vdc" ?view "spectre" ?mode "r")
would open automatically the windows. (needed Alt-tab though to come back to emacs focus)
_____WHAT'S UP KNOW_____
Now i use an intermediate script called "~/Skill/ipcPipe2CAT.sh" that generate a named pipe "/tmp/ipcPipe2CAT_$USER", listen on it and echo to stdout when something comes. Emacs sends a string to it and Cadence (ipcBeginProcess "~/Skill/ipcPipe2CAT.sh" "" 'socketHandler) read from it.
